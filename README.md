# My PhD Dissertation
Model based analysis of multimodal neuroimaging: from neural masses to spectral graph theory.

### How to compile:
I recommend downloading TexMaker or installing LaTeX workshop extension with VSCode, then compiling the `dissertation.tex` file. 

### How to create slides with jupyter:
Install [rise](https://rise.readthedocs.io). This only works with `jupyter notebook` right now, and is not compatible with `jupyter lab`.
